# Python script to crop the white matter volume from the 
# high resolution reference model and apply on it a 3 classes 
# unsupervised segmentation through FAST-FSL tool.
# 
# REQUIRES FSL (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FAST)
# Note: Since FSL tools work only in linux based OS, this script 
#       has been launch from WSL2
