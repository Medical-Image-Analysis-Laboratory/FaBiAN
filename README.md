FaBiAN is the first numerical phantom that simulates realistic T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the developing fetal brain throughout gestation.

Implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks, R2019a), FaBiAN is open source. It is built on segmented high-resolution anatomical images of the fetal brain and relies on the extended phase graph (EPG) formalism [1] of the MR signal formation. It reproduces as closely as possible the physical principles involved in fast spin echo (FSE) sequences and provides:  
* a realistic setup that accounts for stimulated echoes and intensity non-uniformity fields, and that includes stochastic movements of the fetus;  
* a general framework that makes it possible to adjust the simulation of FSE sequences to the specificities of the various MR vendors (currently, MR acquisition schemes from Siemens Healthineers and GE Healthcare are implemented);  
* a high flexibility in the choice of the sequence parameters and anatomical settings available to the user that allows for simulating images of the fetal brain acquired on various MR scanners and at different clinical magnetic field strengths (1.5T and 3T) throughout development;  
* a controlled environment that supports reproducibility studies.

Thanks to the close resemblance of the simulated images with real clinical MR acquisitions of the fetal brain across maturation, FaBiAN aims at providing the community with a unified environment for the evaluation and validation of advanced post-processing techniques dedicated to improving the analysis of fetal brain MR images and supporting accurate diagnosis. Other applications include data augmentation strategies using the generated images to complement clinical fetal datasets that remain scarce.

The script "FaBiAN_demo.m" provides two examples to generate representative MR images of the fetal brain at different gestational ages, obtained from simulated (i) Half-Fourier Acquisition Single-shot Turbo spin Echo (HASTE) sequences at 1.5T, and (ii) Single-Shot Fast Spin Echo (SS-FSE) sequences at 3T using the main script "FaBiAN_main.m".


## Dependencies

All code is self-contained and subfunctions are located in the /Utilities folder with the exception of the EPG simulations over one echo train for multi-spin echo sequences, which is required to compute the T2 decay in every voxel of the fetal brain volume and can be downloaded here [2].

In this first version of FaBiAN, the fetal brain model is based on high-resolution anatomical images from a normative spatiotemporal MRI atlas of the fetal brain [3]. Anatomical images of the developing fetal brain and their corresponding segmentations can be downloaded from: http://crl.med.harvard.edu/research/fetal_brain_atlas/.

Non-linear slowly-varying intensity non-uniformities due to transmit field inhomogeneities (B1+) are based on BrainWeb estimations from real scans to simulate T2-weighted images [4] and can be downloaded from: https://brainweb.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/brainweb/about_sbd.html.
